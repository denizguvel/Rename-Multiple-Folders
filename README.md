# Rename-Multiple-Folders

Problem : After image compression at imagecompressor.com , at the end of the folder names "-min" is added.

If you used those folders in a web project or different purpose , You would want to change the folder names in the original names.

More than 11 or 1100 files you do not want to rename by hand :)

Solution: Create a basic python program to rename multiple files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a mini program to rename multiple folder names that has same character.

Main purpose of this program is cut the '-min.' part of compressed image folders downloaded from "imagecompressor.com" after compression.

Images inside of the folder are  test images  for this program.

All information will have been given you at the command line interface after run the python file.

Modules:

import os
import time
import sys
import random
